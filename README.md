# SBTCVM Gen 4

Rust-driven version of SBTCVM. This version attempts to build on any advancements made in the experimental Gen 3 and provides a full refactor of the codebase including a switch to exclusively ternary use internally

Currently main focus is on the actual implementation of balanced ternary in memory and operations associated with it
